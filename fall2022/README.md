# Fall 2022

## Announcements

- Paper presentation schedule is announced, see Paper Review and Presentation section.
- Deadline for project proposal submission: **November 14, 2022, Monday (end of day)**. See Course Project section below for details.

## General Information

[Syllabus](syllabus.pdf)

## Lecture Slides

Week 1: [Introduction](slides/Introduction.pdf)

Week 2: [Technology Overview](slides/TechnologyOverview.pdf)

Week 3: [GPS](slides/GPS.pdf)

## Paper Review and Presentation

Constitutes 20% of the total grade.

The students are expected to
- Select a journal/conference paper and confirm it by me via e-mail (can.tunca at boun.edu.tr)
- Select a presentation slot (first come first serve, send your preference to me via e-mail)
- Review the selected paper
- Present it to the class (20-30 minutes including questions and discussion, a presentation with approximately 10 slides is recommended)

There are only a couple restrictions for selecting a paper:
- It should be relevant to the syllabus in some way (methods/algorithms, technologies, devices...)
- It should be a recent paper (published within the last 5 years)

If you face difficulties finding relevant papers, you can have a look at the Recommended Publications section below.

**Deadline for paper selection: October 24, 2022, Monday (end of day)**

## Course Project

Constitutes 40% of the total grade. Two stages: Project Proposal (10%), Final Report/Presentation (30%)

Some remarks:
- Projects are to be done individually (no teams).
- You are free to select your own topic. It could be the implementation of a solution discussed in a class on a mobile app or a simulation environment. It could be a solution on a pre-recorded dataset found on web...
- Comparison to some ground truth (either numeric or visual) and/or a demo is expected.

Project Proposal
- 1-2 pages proposal document, to be submitted via e-mail (can.tunca at boun.edu.tr)
- 10 minutes presentation in class (**Date: November 16, 2022**)

Project Final Report and Presentation
- Final report (6-10 pages)
- Presentation and Demo (Date to be announced, probably the last week)

**Deadline for project proposal submission: November 14, 2022, Monday (end of day)**

## Recommended Publications

Here are some publications/conferences that tend to contain good papers relevant to mobile positioning/localization.

- MDPI Sensors
